## Problems Encountered and Resolution

During the development of this CRUD app, I encountered a challenge when adding an asynchronous function to the `useEffect` within the Read component. To ensure a smooth user experience and prevent errors, I resolved this issue by placing the async function within the `useEffect` and including necessary conditional checks to ensure the user object is defined before proceeding with data retrieval.

This experience demonstrates my problem-solving abilities and determination to deliver a polished, error-free application.

Thank you for considering my project as a testament to my skills as a junior developer. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require further information.
